        <h2>Insurance Subsidies</h2>
        <p>
            Government facilitation of insurance - including tax incentives encouraging employer-provided insurance benefits - exemplifies how the submerged state “obscures the role of government and exaggerates that of the market” (Mettler 2011, p.20).

            For instance, most Americans receive health coverage through their employers without realizing the significant tax subsidy incentivizing this system. The exclusion for employer contributions reduces federal income and payroll taxes by over $250 billion annually (Mettler 2011, p.32).

            Yet employees are largely unaware of these “regressive” tax breaks “disproportionately allocated to those in higher tax brackets” underwriting their coverage (Mettler 2011, p.33). This health insurance tax expenditure is among the largest in the federal budget yet its workings are “very difficult for anyone other than experts to comprehend” obscuring its effects (Mettler 2011, p.33). This is despite the ACA and other policy changes raising the salience and debate over the government’s role in healthcare.

            Similarly, few recognize government backing supporting another common form of household risk management - home and rental insurance facilitated through private insurers. Federal subsidies including housing assistance, state insurance risk pools, and premium discounts allow many to afford coverage against threats from flooding, fire damage, and other disasters (Mettler 2011). Yet the complex public-private structure masks the enabling role of such social protection policy.

            Making visible these key areas where government activity merges unseen into the marketplace remains critical for tax policy reform and shoring up the American opportunity compact. As Mettler summarizes, illuminating how the submerged state “privatizes risk management” is prerequisite to ensuring security and shared prosperity (Mettler 2011, p.36).
