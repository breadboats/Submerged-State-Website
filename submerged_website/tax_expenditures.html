        <h2>Tax Expenditures</h2>
        <p>

            In her 2011 book, political scientist Suzanne Mettler explores the concept of the “submerged state” - federal policies and programs that provide substantial benefits to citizens, but which operate “under the radar” and are largely invisible in their implementation (Mettler, 2011). One prominent submerged state mechanism Mettler analyzes is tax expenditures - subsidies and incentives provided through the tax code rather than by direct spending. 
        </p>
            Examples of tax expenditures include tax credits, exemptions, deductions, and exclusions. Mettler estimates that in 2008, tax expenditures amounted to $1 trillion in support for individuals and families, compared to $686 billion for traditional direct social spending (Mettler, 2011).

            Despite their value, tax expenditures are often less visible and transparent than traditional social programs. As Mettler notes, many “recipients of such submerged benefits do not recognize them as forms of government social provision” (Mettler, 2011). The benefit comes in the form of reduced taxes owed rather than a direct payment or check, obscuring their role as a form of government support. 
        </p>
            However, tax expenditures serve substantially similar policy goals as other entitlement programs. For instance, the mortgage interest tax deduction functions similarly to housing assistance programs. Yet this link is largely unseen by the public. Additionally, the complexity of the tax code makes many tax expenditures difficult to disentangle and evaluate.

            These “policy design choices” Mettler argues, have “significant political consequences” (Mettler, 2011). Because tax expenditures operate stealthily, they may reduce civic awareness and engagement. If citizens do not perceive a policy’s impacts, they will be less inclined to organize in support of or opposition to it. This may enable certain interest groups to protect favored tax provisions. It also can disadvantage policies targeting low-income groups less equipped to advocate through lobbying. Thus, improving the visibility and transparency of tax expenditures and other submerged policies could produce a more equitable policy process.
