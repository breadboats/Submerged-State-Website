                <h1>Policy Design</h1>
                <p>The design of submerged policies is characterized by their indirect and often non-transparent nature. Unlike direct spending programs, these policies are typically woven into the tax code or embedded within complex regulations, making them less visible to the public. This obscurity can lead to a lack of public awareness and accountability, potentially affecting the equitable distribution of benefits.</p>
                <p>Understanding the intricacies of such policy design is crucial for evaluating their impact and effectiveness.</p>

                <h2>Mortgage Interest Deduction</h2>
                <p>    To illustrate this, we'll follow the story of mortage interest deduction;
                    <p>     The Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID) in the United States is a prime example of a submerged policy. It allows homeowners to deduct the interest they pay on their mortgage from their taxable income. As a policy tool embedded in the tax code, its benefits are indirect and less visible compared to direct spending programs.</p>
                <p>The MID's complexity and relative obscurity in the tax code mean that many beneficiaries may not realize they are receiving a government-supported benefit. This lack of visibility reduces public scrutiny and debate. Moreover, the MID tends to disproportionately benefit higher-income households, raising questions about the equitable distribution of its advantages. Evaluating the MID's actual impact on homeownership rates is challenging, reflecting the nuanced challenges in assessing submerged policies.</p>

                <h2>Taking a Closer Look at the MID</h2>
                <p> The Mortgage Interest Deduction has been part of the U.S. tax code since the Revenue Act of 1913, allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage interest payments from their taxable income (Ventry, 2010). While the policy has gone through modifications, its core design remains premised on incentivizing homeownership through the tax system.

                    <p> Specifically, the MID currently allows homeowners to deduct interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt on primary residences and second homes (Desilver, 2018). This constitutes an indirect subsidy delivered through reduced taxes rather direct spending. The value of deduction depends on a filer's marginal tax rate, resulting in larger benefits for higher bracket taxpayers.
                
                        <p>Analyses reveal over 77% of MID tax expenditures flow to households earning over $100,000, with only modest ownership incentives for middle and lower-income groups (Gruber et al., 2017). This upside-down effect illustrates the vertical inequities that can become embedded and obscured within submerged policies like the MID. 
                            <img src="MID_chart.png" alt="MID Chart" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                
                            <p> The outlay costs of the MID - estimated at over $25 billion in foregone revenue annually - have provoked debate over its effectiveness in expanding affordable homeownership (Desilver, 2018). Yet assessments remain challenging given the deduction becomes "hidden in plain sight" within individual tax returns (Ventry, 2010). Its obscure design thus enables an expensive homeowner subsidy to persist without deeper public scrutiny.

                <h1>Why Submerged Policy Design Matters</h1>
                
                <p>  On the surface, obscuring policies through the tax code can appear as a benign technicality. Yet the hidden nature of submerged programs like the mortgage interest deduction carries far-reaching impacts and implications that citizens and policymakers alike cannot afford to ignore.  
                
                    <p>  First, keeping policies invisible to the public eye risks concentrating benefits among groups sophisticated enough to capture them while avoiding accountability. The MID’s tilt toward upper-income households reveals the potential for embedded inequities within policy intricacies receiving little scrutiny. Absent transparency and simplification, self-serving interests can more easily shape policy from the shadows.
                
                        <p>  Additionally, submerging expensive programs hinders assessment of their effectiveness compared to alternatives. The poorly targeted homeownership incentives of the MID come at an estimated $25 billion yearly cost in foregone federal revenue. But with deductions woven quietly into individual returns, critical analysis lags. 
                
                            <p>  Ultimately, illumination enables accountability. Shedding light on obscured policies allows citizens and officials to have open debate on who stands to win or lose from policy design choices and whether funds achieve intended goals. Public policy built to last requires visibility and input to adapt to changing needs. For the trillions spent through submerged programs, opacity should not be taken lightly. The future demands policies designed for understanding.
