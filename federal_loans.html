        <h2>Federal Loans</h2>
    </p>
        
    </p>
        
    <p>
       Through initiatives like guaranteed student loans and income-based repayment, the government now functions as the primary funder sustaining individual access to higher education. Yet the administrative complexity of loan programs and notion of repayment renders this funding stream largely invisible in the mind of recipients (Mettler, 2011). 
    </p>

        Mettler surfaces the extensive scale of federal lending supporting higher education. By 2008, over 23 million borrowers held $600 billion in outstanding student debt through Department of Education funding, a figure eclipsing total national credit card liability (Mettler, 2011). 
    </p>          
        Despite this expanse, 60% of student borrowers interviewed did not recognize loans constituted government social spending that enabled their college access (Mettler, 2011). This misrecognition stems from policy delivery blending unseen into private market transactions. The funds appear as standard borrowed money rather than visible grant aid, limiting awareness of public facilitation.

        Obscuring the governmentâ€™s central role in student lending carries consequences. It can inhibit public debate over appropriate loan limits, interest rates caps, and college affordability measures. Individual confusion over loan terms can also undermine responsible use and timely repayment. Further, regressive features often end up buried within complex loan policy fine print, as awareness focuses upon rising sticker prices not subtler financing choices. 
    </p>
        Bringing transparency to how loan programs shape opportunity could reframe critical choices over sustaining investment in affordable mass higher education.
